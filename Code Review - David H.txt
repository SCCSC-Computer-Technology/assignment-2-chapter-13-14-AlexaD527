[] The code compiles with no warnings and the data grid populates on startup.
[] The method and variable names are descriptive. Your comments are like mine, where you don't bother re-explaining something already covered.
[] I did not see unused or repetitive code.
[] Leaving empty fields does not generate dialog message, but returning zero matches does, which I think works fine.
[] The only issue I found was how the price range works. If you only use one field it works fine, not set up to work as a range.
I think you would have to parse out both fields first, then just do a single query statement that has two where clauses.
[] I like that you did not clear the fields after running queries, because the user can go back to a previous search more easily.
[] I did not reset the grid view if a button is clicked while having a blank field like you did. I ended up putting a reset button instead.
The advantage to yours is that it does bog the user down with error messages and keeps the code cleaner, its also one less button.
I think the only advantage to my solution is having a unique dialog depending on the situation. I believe it to be a matter of preference though.
