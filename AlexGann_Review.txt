Putting the price sorting on its own form is an interesting demonstration of technical prowess, 
but it feels like an odd decision and breaks up the flow of the interface.

For both unit and price sort, it would feel much more natural to switch the 'more than' and 
'less than' fields to make it match the ascending order of the grid view.

I also feel like I should have gotten an error when I intentionally placed the numbers backwards 
to test it. Defaulting to 'less than' may be confusing for end users.

There could afford to be more comments in the code, and names could be more verbose as well. 
The code is a little hard to follow with limited comments and shortened names.

Some more information on what difficulties were faced with the existing columns in Form2 would 
have been helpful, I'm not sure why manually re-creating the columns was necessary.
